## EMQX provides support for two primary log handlers: `file` and `console`, with an additional `audit` handler specifically designed to always direct logs to files.
## The system's default log handling behavior can be configured via the environment variable `EMQX_DEFAULT_LOG_HANDLER`, which accepts the following settings:
##
##   - `file`: Directs log output exclusively to files.
##   - `console`: Channels log output solely to the console.
##
## It's noteworthy that `EMQX_DEFAULT_LOG_HANDLER` is set to `file` when EMQX is initiated via systemd `emqx.service` file.
## In scenarios outside systemd initiation, `console` serves as the default log handler.
